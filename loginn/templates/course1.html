            <h2>About the Course</h2>
            <p>The foundation of every website you see on the internet is HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language. It is the
                standard markup language for creating and structuring web content. If you want to build websites or work
                in web development, learning HTML is a must-have skill.
                This introductory course is intended to give you a strong foundation in HTML. You will learn how to
                create and structure HTML documents, which will include headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images.
                You'll also discover how to use basic HTML tags like
                < div>, < span>, < table>, < form> and to create more complex layouts and structures.
            <br><br>{% load static %}<img id="html"src="{% static 'images/html.png' %}" alt=""></p>
            <p>The course is designed to be simple to follow and comprehend. It begins with an overview of HTML,
                including its history and the significance of semantic markup. Then you'll learn about HTML's
                fundamental elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and lists, and how to use them to create
                well-structured content. <br><br>

                You will learn how to add links and images to your HTML documents, as well as how to create tables and
                forms, as you progress through the course. You'll also learn why accessibility is important in web
                development and how to use HTML to make your content more accessible to all users.</p>

            <p>By the end of this course, you will have a firm grasp on HTML and how it is used to create and structure
                web content. You will be able to create your own HTML documents from scratch and will have the knowledge
                required to begin building your own websites.
