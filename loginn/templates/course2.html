            <h2>About the Course</h2>
            <p>Java is a popular programming language developed by Sun Microsystems, which was later acquired by Oracle Corporation. It was initially released in 1995 and is widely used for developing various applications, including web and mobile applications, desktop software, games, and more. Java is an object-oriented programming language that uses a syntax similar to C and C++, making it easy to learn for programmers familiar with these languages.
            <br><br>{% load static %}<img id="html"src="{% static 'images/Java.jpg' %}" alt=""></p>
            <p>One of the primary advantages of Java is its platform independence, which means that Java code can run on different operating systems, such as Windows, Linux, and macOS, without the need for any modification. This is made possible by the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which interprets Java code and translates it into machine code that can run on the underlying operating system. <br><br>

                Java has a large community of developers who contribute to its open-source libraries and frameworks, making it a versatile language for a wide range of applications. With its robust security features and scalability, Java is an ideal choice for developing enterprise-level applications.</p>

            <p>By the end of this course, you will have a firm grasp on JAVA, the concept of Oop and how it is used. You will be able to create your own java programs from scratch.
<br><br>
                This course is a great way to get started with Java whether you are a complete beginner or have some
                experience with Java programming language. You will be able to apply what you learn to real-world situations and
                start building your own programs in no time thanks to hands-on exercises and real-world examples. </p>
